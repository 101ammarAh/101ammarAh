## 🛠️ What I Love Working With

- **Programming**: Python is my go-to language for most tasks, but I also enjoy working with C++, JavaScript, and even Bash scripts when needed.
- **Frameworks and Tools**: From building web apps with Django and Flask to deploying them with Docker and managing infrastructure with Terraform, I enjoy bringing ideas to life end-to-end.
- **AI/ML**: I specialize in Computer Vision, NLP, and Deep Learning using tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and advanced techniques like Vision Transformers, Stable Diffusion, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- **Cloud Platforms**: I leverage AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to deploy scalable AI solutions.
- **Data Pipelines**: I thrive on automating data processing workflows with tools like SQL, BigQuery, and ETL pipelines.
- **Visualization and Insights**: I enjoy transforming raw data into actionable insights using Power BI, Tableau, and Looker Studio.

## 📈 What I’ve Worked On

### ✨ Making AI Smarter and Faster
- I’ve built systems that automate ETL workflows, reducing manual intervention by 95%. Think of scripts that orchestrate AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions to handle massive datasets seamlessly.
- In another project, I developed a Recommendation Agent powered by **RAG** and clustering techniques, boosting engagement rates significantly. I even optimized the algorithms using **cuML/RAPIDS**, cutting processing time by 40%.

### 🎥 Object Tracking in Videos
- Using Facebook’s **Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)** and Flask, I created a pipeline to track objects in videos. Imagine breaking down a video into frames with FFmpeg, applying advanced AI models, and deploying it on AWS EC2 to deliver multi-object tracking efficiently.

### 📷 Sorting Through Photos with AI
- Ever wanted an AI to organize your photo gallery? I developed a photo culling algorithm leveraging **MobileNetV3** and DBSCAN to detect duplicates, closed eyes, and even prioritize aesthetically pleasing images. It’s a tool that saves countless hours for photographers.

### 🔮 Predicting the Future with Data
- I worked on forecasting fuel prices using **LSTM**, XGBoost, and **Neural Prophet**, achieving impressive accuracy. These time series models processed years of historical data to predict trends for the next few weeks.

### ✍️ Making NLP Work for Businesses
- Whether it’s creating a chatbot using a **decoder-only transformer model** or designing a semantic search system using **embeddings**, I’ve applied NLP to solve real-world challenges. One of my projects even connected SQL databases with NLP models for intelligent query processing.

### 🖌️ Generating AI Art and Deep Fakes
- I explored the creative side of AI with **Stable Diffusion**, deploying models that generated realistic deep fake images and replicated faces with high precision. I also trained **LoRA models** to add stylistic features, pushing the boundaries of generative AI.  

### Intelligent Banking Assistant
- Imagine a chatbot that understands not only your queries but also retrieves relevant data efficiently. I developed one using **Django**, **LlamaIndex**, and **Pinecone**, combining RAG with traditional SQL databases to create a robust AI assistant.

### Superresolution for Images
- Enhancing image quality has been a fascinating challenge. I worked on a project using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to upscale hyperspectral and RGB images by up to 8x, significantly improving clarity.

### Web App Deployment with DevOps
- I containerized a Flask and React app with Docker, automated deployments using GitHub Actions, and managed infrastructure with Terraform. It was an exciting blend of software engineering and DevOps practices.

## 🌟 Why I Love What I Do

There’s something magical about combining creativity and logic to solve problems, whether it’s training an AI model to interpret data or deploying a solution that impacts users directly. I believe in constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies to push the limits of what’s possible.
